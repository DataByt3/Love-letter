# Dear Chloe,

I’ve been trying to find the perfect way to express how much I admire you, but it’s hard to capture in words. Every time I see you, I’m reminded of how special you are — not just because of your incredible spirit, but because of the kindness and positivity you bring to every moment.

I’ve created something for you, something that shows just a fraction of how much you inspire me. It’s a website, and through it, I hope to share my thoughts, feelings, and everything I appreciate about you. This message is just the beginning.

I don’t expect anything in return; I just wanted you to know. Take your time, and when you’re ready, I’d love for you to see it.

With all my heart,

-Ram Jann
